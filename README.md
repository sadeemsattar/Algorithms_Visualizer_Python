# Implementation and Visualization of Graph Algorithms using NetworkX and Tkinter

#Experimental Setup

•	Visual Studio Code as Code Editor 
•	Python Installation for using it as programming language. 
•	Installation of NetworkX Library for creation, manipulation and study of the structure of complex networks. 
•	Installation of matplotlib library for low level graph plotting. 
•	Installation of Tkinter library for Graphical User Interface. 


#Step To Run:

1) Open vs code terminal in the current directory of AlgoProject
2) Write python interface.py
3) Program execute and an interface window is open  
4) Now first select no of nodes from drop down menue of interface window
5) And then click on select node button
6) This operation read the file and to verify the file name is shown in terminal
7) Now from algorithm to apply drop down select algorithm to apply 
8) This operation show the graph window af selected algorithm
9) Now close the graph window and repeat step 4 to apply other algorithm on same no of nodes or by selectig different
10) to terminate the program close interface window
